hello and welcome once again to the india today conclave to a very special session that we have
0:07
bulls in our memory shop debating heritage history
0:13
and hubris rather intriguingly titled but let me try and decode it
0:19
in a way which is perhaps a little simpler we live ladies and gentlemen in an age
0:25
of contested legacies of historical figures are rewriting reclaiming
0:31
reinterpreting history in a manner that only seems to further polarize society today
0:39
is there a way forward where we can bring together an objective rendition of
0:44
our history without breeding sharp social and political divisions
0:50
that's what we want to address today and we have two eminent speakers
0:55
who hopefully will try and demystify this topic for us
1:02
vikram sampath is uh the author of two uh a
1:08
two-part biography of savarkar the second part is just out
1:15
historian and author dr vikram sampath is joined by dr shashi tarou
1:20
who is not just a politician but i think at times would rather be first described
1:27
as a saita academy award winner for his writing including his most recent book
1:33
which looks at the issue of nationalism so thank you both very much for joining us and chashi let's kick it off straight
1:39
with you by asking this question which is often being asked what are these
1:44
fundamental fault lines that underlie contemporary history debates history
1:50
writing today is it naruvians versus the hindutvavadis
1:55
is it left versus right is it constitutionalists versus those
2:00
who see a an india that stretches into antiquity what really defines the history debate
2:09
today i think what's happened rajdeep is that is that what has opened up in the last
2:14
few years with the ascent of muditra if you like hindutva plus the
2:21
personality culture mr modi in power and the followers they both attract
2:27
what has changed i think is that an issue which many of us grew up assuming had been long settled has now reopened
2:33
fundamentally and that goes back to the founding of the republic the uh the moment of partition because
2:39
partition didn't happen as you remember the the split in the nationalist movement didn't happen over ideology it wasn't marxist versus capitalists it
2:47
didn't happen over geography it wasn't north versus south it happened on one key question
2:52
the question was is religion the determinant of our nationhood and those who argued that yes religion was their
2:58
identity and that made them a nation they left and they created pakistan and
3:03
everyone else who remained pretty much of any consequence starting with mahatma gandhi embracing nehru maulana azad
3:10
sadar patel rajendra prasad the works they all said no our freedom struggle
3:15
was for everyone and of course dr ambedkar then enshrined this in a constitution over
3:22
debated over two and a half years before being adopted which enshrined that principle that india will be a
3:28
secular pluralistic state with room for everyone irrespective of what their color of skin was what the language they
3:35
spoke at home what religion they had or chose to worship what caste they belong to that as long as they were citizens of
3:41
this republic everyone would be equal now that fundamental idea was i think
3:46
core to the evolution of indian politics for the next six decades plus
3:52
and now we have a different ethos in power which argues that no
3:57
india is fundamentally a hindu country and that everybody else here is either a guest or
4:03
an interloper and that the institutions of the state the laws of the state the practices of the state
4:10
must reflect an allegiance to a certain cultural civilizational understanding of
4:15
india which has nothing to do with the idea of india enshrined in the constitution and that i think is the
4:22
fundamental fault line because it is you know people keep saying no one gave you the right to have your own idea of india
4:28
my answer is i'm afraid my idea of india is the idea in the constitution where does yours come from
4:33
you want to answer that where does yours come from the suggestion that shashi taru is making is that the fundamental
4:40
fault line lies in how we in a way identify ourselves as indians do we identify ourselves in
4:47
india through the constitution or do we identify ourselves through religious identity
4:53
rajdeep as a non-politician and as a historian i'd like i'd like to answer it from that perspective uh that you know
4:59
our we might be politically independent but i think our minds are far from decolonized uh and we particularly this
5:06
finds its manifestation in scholarship in historiography very very very faithfully been adherents of that
5:13
infamous macaulay's minute of 1835 that the whole role of education is to create
5:19
a class of people who are interpreters who are only in color and blood indian but in our morals opinions tastes and
5:26
intellect we are english and this manifests it's probably most germane in the way history is written in
5:32
india uh and i'm not making it political at all uh i mean you're welcome you're welcome to make it
5:39
political it is political let's be honest so the first brush that a young indian
5:44
will have with the history of her country is the textbooks and what what does she see there uh the story of her
5:50
country is almost shown in third person as though it belongs to some other nation you know while i it's not my case to
5:57
argue that the role of history or historians is to generate pride and hysteria and jingoism and all of that
6:04
the converse also holds that to denigrate your past to feel a constant sense of apology about it
6:12
i think that's been the bane of historiography because sadly even at the heights of the british raj you had space
6:19
for nationalist historians mukherjee rc majumdar
6:24
you know vk rajvadi so many of them bhandarkar sivi vedhya but then sadly post independence and i think the
6:30
congress party unwittingly gave away that space of historiography to the uh
6:36
stranglehold of marxist historians and in a in a discipline like this which thrives on multiplicity of views which
6:43
uh you know thrives on dissent discussion debate differences of opinion healthy discussions i think the thraldom
6:50
with which academic historiography i'm talking of which has been largely controlled by a clique of the but what
6:57
we would call as leftist historians i think it's distorted history and created several fault lines i'll just state one
7:04
or two you know the story of india is a story of invaders from their perspective we've not
7:11
reclaimed that so a young person again who reads the story of india it's a long litany of invasions starting from that
7:18
myth of the aryan invasion theory to a series of battles that we have lost we're a nation of losers it seems to
7:25
most people that the very fact that we are around as a civilization shows there must have been some battles we also won and the
7:32
resistance that was put which is curiously underplayed or subjugated in our history books the other thing we are
7:38
sitting in delhi but the historiography of india is extremely delhi centric both of us come from below the vindhyas i
7:45
think stories from our part of the country don't find mention as much as some obscure dynasties which are bygoted
7:52
lodis and khiljis find incommensurate you know mention in books the
7:57
vijayanagara empire or the chola empire the rashtrakuta sathavanas pallavas the travancore rulers the mysore wadhyayas
8:04
the homes of northeast the nagas tripuris the rulers of manipur i think india needs to
8:10
reclaim her history from delhi and that is these are these constant battles that keep happening in
8:18
historiography and also you know a refusal to acknowledge the darker
8:24
elements the darker aspects of indian history particularly medieval india with islamic invasions trying to brush that
8:31
under the carpet american historian will durant had called the islamic invasion of india as the bloodiest chapter of
8:38
human human history but is that does that find a mention uh in our books in the way it should we
8:45
we labor under this false assumption that talking about the truth will upset
8:51
contemporary social issues but dare i say that you know national unity or
8:57
social cohesion cannot stand the edifice of national unity or social cohesion cannot stand on the shaky and false
9:04
foundations of whitewashed history so faith the truth in the eye history
9:09
worldwide offers these spaces to heal to uh to relive the past get over it make
9:16
peace with it move on i think we've not done that and that is one reason these battles keep happening what we saw in
9:23
ayodhya what we keep seeing all the time these renaming of cities these are a manifestation of that same
9:29
idea that somehow someone is going to feel bad if you speak the truth and so we need to push all the muck
9:36
under the carpet and put deodorant at some point the stink will show up and that's what i expected
9:42
basically vikram wants india to reclaim its history from delhi from macaulay's
9:48
children from from those who in the nerubian age he believes whitewashed history and
9:54
didn't tell the little subaltern histories i could add a number of other names you know suhilde who took on uh
10:00
you know the the the there are many others whose names come out is that true somewhere or do
10:06
you believe he's taking an extreme position and going to the extent where now i read maharana pratap actually
10:12
defeated akbar in the battle of haldikari which is a plain lie but it suits a particular form of history
10:17
history writing so so this is process i'm with vikram halfway that is much of
10:23
what he said in the first half of his response i agree totally with and i have myself and my in my own way express the
10:29
same concern that there's a whole lot of indian history we've not been able to reclaim i studied in bombay calcutta and
10:35
delhi and i didn't learn a line about the vijayanagara empire and even less about the cholas the pallavas and so on
10:41
whereas as vikram points out the the smallest dynasties in delhi we learned by heart their dates so there is
10:47
certainly a delhi-centric vision of indian history teaching but on the last part of what vikram said i have
10:53
a profound disagreement i think that what we have to look at is that when we came to independence
11:00
we really did not choose to be a mirror image of pakistan pakistan used history to forge
11:07
this rather intolerant idea i've met pakistanis who were horrified to realize that the history they read
11:13
there is even an excellent book by the bio-pakistan historian comparing the history that was taught in indian
11:19
schools up to the 70s what was taught in pakistani schools where in pakistan it was all about hatred of hindus the
11:25
glorious 5000 year history of islam in india etc etc and essentially a denial of any
11:31
syncretism whereas in india history and i know you don't fully approve of this but history was pressed
11:37
into the nation building project in the service of nation building and so there was a desire to elide over some of the
11:44
more unpleasant details destruction of temples uh some of the the horrors that happened while at the same time
11:50
stressing on the commonalities the cooperation uh the harmony that also featured throughout the same periods and
11:58
i think that that was a laudable objective in a country like ours first of all unlike pakistan we were a
12:03
democracy second unlike pakistan we were a much more pluralistic society we had
12:08
to knit together people of various differences and we didn't feel i think i shouldn't say we i was a kid myself at
12:15
the time uh the nation didn't feel that accentuating remembered divisions would have been the
12:21
right way to go if you're knitting a nation together and to my mind that was actually the right choice today what's
12:27
happening is we are scratching at wounds that had actually healed and your reopening and fresh fresh sort of drops
12:34
of blood are emerging from from scars that should have been allowed to heal less sleeping dogma's lie would have
12:41
been my preferred option but unfortunately this is where we're going that might have been the case dr i think
12:47
in the in the immediate decades after independence but i think have the wounds really healed that's also the question
12:53
this as i said are we allowing them to heal well i mean sometimes just talking the truth ubuntu and the truth and
12:59
reconciliation commission which south africa did of course the victims and perpetrators they were alive and so they
13:05
could come face to face but i think it's a civilizational wound and a civilizational victim i'll just give one
13:10
example i mean uh we were the greatest you know universities uh in in in the
13:16
world uh the oxfords and princetons of the world in vikram srila taksha sheila nalanda and when nalanda was
13:23
you know vandalized books burned for one year they say there's so much of manuscripts and books by this bygoted
13:30
bhaktiya khilji today if you go out of nalanda the ruins the town is bhaktiyapur
13:37
the station there is bhaktiyarpur station in which country of the world will a person who actually desecrated
13:43
your temple of knowledge be actually valorized and also by doing this i think somewhere we're
13:50
putting the albatross of these invasions on the neck of young a young indian
13:55
muslim man or woman who is not responsible for the invasions of ghazni gori orangazeb and tipu and all these if
14:02
like in the morning mr arif muhammad khan was telling you rajdeep that a muslim need not represent a muslim in
14:09
parliament or assembly similarly you need not have an icon created for the community who belongs to the same
14:14
community you can have anybody else but even if you want to have you know muslim icons for the community you have a range
14:22
of others from raheem to kabir to rashkhan to sansunal sharif to apj abdul
14:28
kalam to there's so many others why would you assume that talking about the atrocities
14:35
of aurangazeb or tipu sultan or ghazni is going to make the indian muslim feel
14:40
very you know bad about just two days back you had anas haqqani who put out a tweet celebrating the fact that you know
14:49
they went to the shrine of the mazar of ghazni mahmud ghazni and also gloated over the fact that
14:55
he crushed the somnath idol so are we not doing in some way putting that same
15:01
seed of you know separatism that we are trying to whitewash these uh invaders
15:06
only so that you feel nice and you feel integrated into the society i don't think that is it about white washing or
15:12
is it about demonization the moment the road is named after aurangzeb or you know you've got a city like
15:17
aurangabad immediately remove it so so you're moving from whitewashing history as you call it you call it white washing
15:23
that was going on to now deliberately looking for those figures through whom
15:28
you can demonize a community so we seem to be moving from one extreme to the other extremes
15:35
because it's a very important point when this this thugish group called the
15:41
hindu cena recently defaced some road signs it was no longer about what a particular
15:46
ruler did right so you want aurangzeb road remained for the same reason you don't want bhaktiyapur renamed and i
15:52
understand that but akbar i mean there couldn't have been a greater example of
15:57
the kind of ideal king in the in that particular period of time and his was
16:03
defeated so the only thing that mattered is that he was muslim so they came and defaced the signs for akbar road and i
16:08
said what do they even understand about history what are they doing so when you ask rightly you know why is today's muslim
16:15
feeling offended when ghazni or gory are denounced the answer is because it is instrumentalized to demonize them today
16:22
you talk to to muslims who have absolutely no affinity for ghazni or gory but they're the ones being
16:27
aggressed after when some poor fellow is walking down the street and he's beaten within an inch of his life and told to
16:33
say she run that's not my hindu dharma vikram and that's also not what building
16:38
a democratic society in india can possibly be about which is why i said i think the wounds haven't healed and it's so easy to bring these out so a truth a
16:46
truth and reconciliation commission where we set all this as i said world over history offers these spaces where
16:52
people can talk these uncomfortable truths heal from it learn from past mistakes and
16:58
move on i think we have not made peace with our past and that is why it keeps resurfacing
17:04
every now and then as a cancerous growth from now but who's truth who's truth the question is who's truth let's take a
17:10
look at for example you know who is now being reclaimed in a way uh after having been
17:16
possibly demonized by the congress neherubian elite when you all were in power who who decides who is the real
17:23
savarkar is the sauvakar the freedom fighter as some would like to see him
17:30
or is he a hindutva vadi leader is he someone who called gauraksha's fools and spoke out against untouchability or
17:37
is he this icono uh classic you know figure who has to be only seen as an anti-muslim leader who's truth
17:44
shashi my truth is a combination of all that you said
17:50
these are complex figures they are a bit of all of that but the truth is our politicians reduce them to black and
17:56
white carrier catchers no i think i think in all fairness vikram has done a good job of trying to
18:01
draw in his two volumes and rather hefty volumes we've seen them um a very complex portrait in which he has
18:09
been some would say very generous to the first half of savaka's life and perhaps not critical enough of the second half
18:15
but he's painted it all it's all there and though i haven't read every single word because i would take a year
18:21
of both volumes i have dipped into it and it's a it's a terrific work in terms of trying to reclaim
18:28
for today's generation a person who as you say has only been depicted in one yes total caricature as his great
18:34
nationalist hero or perhaps total caricature as this craven uh supplicant
18:39
for british mercy who then essentially lived on a british pension for many years afterwards and
18:45
and these two contrasting images mean that for some of us it was very difficult to understand
18:50
why savages portrait should be in parliament at all and that too opposite that of mahatma gandhi whereas
18:57
what vikram has depicted particularly the early years up to about the time that he gets sent off to the andamans to
19:03
that cellular jail which i have visited certainly not a salubrious place
19:09
up to that time he was really here somebody i think it was manu pillai in his review of vikram's book said if if
19:15
like bhagat singh he had been hanged instead of sent off to exile and survived might we not be hailing in today as a hero like bhagat singh it's a
19:22
subsequent year the the intention of the philosophy and the uh the bigotry he showed the involvement in the mentoring
19:29
nother god say and and up there all of these things that have cast a shadow over what savaka represents nobody can
19:36
you look at these figures who've traversed you know decades as complex figures or do we tend to look at them as
19:42
black and white figures even bhagat singh you know let's be honest bhagat singh was never close
19:49
to anything remotely connected to hindutva politics and yet today
19:55
he was a communist you know he was a family today no no no but today bhagat singh is
20:01
appropriated by the indian right a socialist is subhanallah
20:06
by the indian right mahatma gandhi you approach appropriate and you appropriate savarkar both together you want to
20:13
appropriate every leader then give the truth i don't know who is you here because as i said i don't belong to any political party uh fortunately you've
20:20
been positioned at the right of the stage that's by design happy to be the centrist but go ahead
20:26
but see uh i mean there are many facets to a person like savarkar who's very very complicated uh figure i've
20:33
dealt in detail about those so-called petitions that they were not mercy petitions that these pension that he was
20:38
receiving is something that he uh that many other revolutionaries who were whose degrees was taken away were given
20:44
by the british the very fact that the british never trusted him if he had become a stooge they would have co-opted
20:49
him he would have been he was a very useful fellow who was trained in law in london he would have been a part of the vice choice council now from a five-year
20:57
captivity in ratnagiri after his release from andamans every time his petition came up for a review the british said we
21:03
don't trust this man because he had these underground networks with bhagat singh with chandrasekhar azad with durga
21:09
bhabhi with sachin the national raj bihari bose all of them so
21:14
from five years the term actually ended to 13 long years that itself showed that the british never trusted him and he was
21:20
not a stooge as is made out to be and also his role in the assassination of gandhiji uh time and time again the
21:26
courts have uh you know honorably exonerated him and when the highest court the supreme court exonerates
21:31
someone i think for political purposes it is unfair to keep on putting that albatross on him but be that as it
21:38
there's a new book out that does exactly that with new research well maybe but then
21:44
i mean for one and a half years the supreme court appointed an amicus curate and uh someone of the stature of justice
21:51
bob day the former cji and justice nageshwar went through the mahatma gandhi trial papers the justice jivan
21:57
lal kapoor commission report and gave out you know a statement in 2018 just three
22:03
years ago that saw workers role in gandhiji's assassination is not something that is up for review and the
22:09
courts have settled it so i think somewhere we should put uh you know dogs to sleep there as you said but you know
22:15
these the the fact rajdeep is have these discussions today we're able to have this mainstream discussion on
22:21
savarkar but in the 50s and 60s i keep talking about this several times someone of the eminence of pandit
22:28
mangeshkar who was in all india radio savarkar was also a prolific marathi poet he wrote
22:34
extensively in marathi sagara prana talmallah and jayus tutte and all of that so this poem which he
22:40
tuned sagara prank which lataji ashaji others sang for which he got a showcase notice asking
22:46
why have you tuned this man's uh why have you tuned this and mangeshkarji gave this two line replies
22:52
saying good poet good poem reason enough to tune but he lost his job for doing this so you make someone a
22:59
persona non-greta you don't even have a discussion on that person and we talk of intolerance today so you know this this
23:06
culture cancel culture of anybody who doesn't fall in this mainstream narrative is a traitor doesn't belong to
23:12
the uh the nationhood i think that is a very problematic uh piece and bhagat
23:18
singh too bhagat singh published savarkar's book on 1857 the fourth edition in his jail diaries uh the hindu
23:26
padpada shahi of savarkar are noted down extensively he's written eulogizing articles on savarkar in the matwala
23:32
newspaper that bhagat singh brought out so i and so this connections between the revolutionaries i think is so
23:38
understudied that's another fault line in our history where we have a very simplistic linear monochromatic
23:44
narrative a richer attenborough film of how india won her freedom i think there are multiple stories multiple narratives
23:51
multiple heroes and heroines and the time has come in this amrit mahot that we kind of revisit those other voices
23:58
and other which are dying to be i think told and heard respond to that dr thiru that the years of the congressification
24:05
of our history uh when the marxist sort of in a way dictated what our history should be is where distortion and dare i
24:12
say intolerance also crept in that there was an unwillingness to read possibly
24:17
other multiple versions that perhaps existed of these same complex figures for the
24:23
longest time even bose was never really done justice in a way by the so-called
24:29
congress historians of the 50s and 60s well i'm not sure that it's fair in a thriving democracy to imply that every
24:37
historian followed a particular line dictated by the ruling party i don't believe that was true i think that in
24:43
fact in some ways some of the critiques of the congress from the left were actually even sharper than perhaps
24:49
what today we're seeing from the right so i don't think it was it was a monochromatic approach having said that
24:55
i'm not going to speak in favor of intolerance i wasn't aware of this episode of pandit
25:01
and i i feel sorry that a such a choice should have been made i no one is defending
25:06
any of the excesses of the past but this water boundary is not a way of responding seriously to a discussion
25:12
about today and tomorrow you know uh you you talk about 2002 riot cigarettes what about 1984 both were bad yeah but let's
25:19
not acknowledge they were both bad and let's talk about how do we prevent either from happening in 2021 that's the
25:25
way in which we have to look at history if you are interested in building a modern progressive democratic democratic
25:31
nation you're saying there's no space for water boundary in here in in our in our history cheap debating point scoring
25:38
you know what about this what about okay we are censoring people now you censored people to go we are arresting people now
25:44
you arrested the emergency those those arguments are not
25:50
what the country ought to be about they're not about what we should aspire to as indians to see in our country i am
25:56
all for reclaiming forgotten voices as vikram says on all sides i might add and
26:01
i think that one of the very important things that you're overlooking in the slight demonization of congress era
26:07
history writing is the very fact that people like bhagat singh nithaji bose and others were honored maybe
26:14
insufficiently according to some were honored sufficiently that today we still speak of them with reverence and these
26:19
are people who obviously were demonized by the brits up to 1947. and when you
26:24
look at the fact that they of course netaji has lots of roads and stadia and so on named after him everywhere uh a
26:30
bhagat singh is an icon that everyone honors today the people don't realize he died in his early 20s was hanged at 21
26:37
or 22 and yet today he is one of the best known punjabis of all time in india
26:42
and somebody who who is revered rightly so for the extraordinary intellect he had and the contribution he made to
26:49
articulating india's aspirations for freedom so it's not as if there was only
26:54
one narrative but let's agree let's concede the point we need to allow other voices to come forward what are these
27:00
voices saying and that's where i want to if the voices are saying you know
27:05
muslims were bad 500 years ago and therefore today's muslims will have to suffer for it and we will do this and
27:12
we'll do that and we will change this and we'll change that then i would have to i have a problem i mean i want to say
27:17
what are you doing to today's india why can't we focus on making a better india for all
27:22
hindus muslims christians a lot instead of fighting these old battles when vikram says that the the wounds
27:28
have not healed you're not allowing them to heal that's my problem let them heal let them heal i remember a conversation
27:35
with shimon peres the former president of israel uh uh in davos this is more than 20 years ago
27:41
we were having dinner it was a casual conversation now that he's passed away i can reveal it and he said to me i hate
27:46
history i said what i said history is my subject what are you telling me sir he said no i hate history i don't want my
27:52
grandson to study history i said why he says the history only is going to make him dwell in the past in real or
27:59
imagined wrongs i want him to focus on the future let him study technology let him study computers i don't want to
28:04
decide history now this is from israel which is steeped in history but i'm just saying here is the kind of here is the
28:11
kind of attitude that a modern forward-looking state is seeking to encourage and we having encouraged it
28:18
having talked about science and iits and aims and the race to space and all of that we are
28:23
now once again slipping back into using history as a battle axe to fight the
28:28
imagined wrongs uh of of of you know for example i lose my job doctor if history
28:34
doesn't become more no i i wonder whether history has history you should write i'll read you
28:39
but history for today's political misuse is what i have a problem no i wonder whether or not always no history has
28:45
always been the handmaiden of the nobody but nothing very special or unique that's happening now or today i think
28:52
time and time again it's a victor who writes uh the story and that african saying that goes there
28:58
is a famous life yeah yeah the the the until the light the lions have their own somebody teller it'll always glorify
29:04
thee look at it august 14th in this amrit mahatsa yeah
29:10
the prime minister of the country says it's going to be it should be looked at as partition horrors remembrance day
29:17
do we want to rekindle the scars of the past or do we want to look ahead i mean this is where it comes to it
29:23
whether our politicians of the time are selectively interpreting history to
29:29
suit their political ends rajid i think it was philosopher george santana who had said
29:34
those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
29:40
yeah and so two million people dead 15 million or so displaced one of the largest
29:46
displacements in human history uh you know in at least the recent times
29:51
i don't as i said i don't know the political motivations of what might happen of that but world over when we
29:56
have holocaust museums are they all celebrating the holocaust when when in israel in germany uh or in the us when
30:04
people go to the to the holocaust museum and see those horrors even now of what happened in those gas chambers are they
30:10
celebrating hitler or is it a reminder that history gives to you that these excesses should never happen again it
30:17
should never be committed again so i think that's a historian speaking not a politician
30:24
you are a politician let's be honest what is partition remembrance day about remembering the
30:31
horrors of partisanship well i think i was probably the first to tweet against this declaration by the prime minister
30:37
that it should be marked as uh as as practitioner horrors remembrance day because it seemed to me targeting
30:42
specifically uh these healed wounds and scratching them but having said that
30:48
i i'm all in favor of memorializing what happened in particular there's a very good partition museum a number it said
30:53
let's have let's have more i mean i've talked about memorializing the atrocities of colonialism not because
30:58
today i want us to go and uh revolt against the brits that's over that's history but but we should understand we
31:04
should as i've said in talking about my book i've said we must must definitely
31:10
forgive but we must not forget now the problem is here we have people who are
31:16
not only prepared not to forget who even even want to revive memories real or
31:21
imagined or what people have forgotten and then instead of forgiving want to
31:26
punish the supposed descendants of those who perpetrated those wrongs
31:32
you cannot correct the wrongs of yesterday by creating new wrongs for tomorrow
31:38
but dr if you want people to not to forget the horrors of colonialism
31:44
and you write a book about the darkness of that period would you also encourage historians then
31:49
to write about the period of medieval age or the age of the so-called invasions that took place
31:56
during the mughal rule or previously during the sultans that there were these horrors that were committed and you
32:02
should not forget them would you say that one is acceptable and one is not or would you say
32:07
you know forget one because today if you forget one you'll open up new scars but don't forget what
32:13
the colonials did because there are no scars to be opened up there dr famously argued for reparations from the from the
32:19
british we don't have reparations to take from muhammad ghazni but the least reparation we can do for our national
32:24
consciousness is to is to remember this the the the remember you can't remember it you can't
32:30
remember it by demolishing a mosque and building it you're again bringing politics to me so
32:36
80 million was the uh you know fall in the subcontinent's population between 1000 ce and 1525 with the end of the
32:43
delhi sultanate so these 80 million people largely hindus in this subcontinent they just didn't drop down
32:49
dead today we still have the hindu kush mountains what is that hindu kush it was a mountain of human skulls
32:56
of hindu slaughter so these are and from 40 000 to 60 000 is the numbers spoken
33:02
of the temples desecrated now you also have condescendingly western historians who come down to us and tell us that
33:09
aurangzeb actually protected more temples than he demolished and so he was a very very you know nice guy and so on
33:16
uh we know these kind of condescending historians who come and teach us what to be tolerant about and intolerant about
33:22
so obviously hitler also could have probably massacred a lot more jews he didn't do it so was he a saint for that
33:27
so i think these kind of perversions uh without and it's i think an intellectual crime to subvert or subordinate the
33:34
truth to political considerations uh which happens on both sides and to tell the truth as it is with the with a group
33:40
of non-ideologically uh you know leaning historians i think is that is the need of the art to ensure that the story of
33:48
india finally gets told to the future generations
33:55
writing about example after example that he's dug up of hindu muslim cooperation during these periods and by all means
34:02
also historian cataloging all the mysteries
34:13
one point of view is in power and is imposing that point of view in everything school textbooks in the states where they're ruling down to the
34:20
official national i mean even talking about about this horrors remembrance there is a very clear demonization
34:27
honestly one community on social media i think this government's so-called supporters would actually castigate the
34:33
government that they're not doing enough to change the textbooks because in seven years in part not and you had a former
34:38
hrd minister who said we have not even we take pride and not a single line of the textbook has been changed so i don't
34:43
know what one minute one minute we now have a film we have a filmmaker mahesh manzarika who
34:50
wants to make a film on goatse announces the film on gandhi jayanti
34:55
and you know obviously is sending out a message you'll have god say you know as a hero trending as the top trend on on
35:02
social media isn't there a mainstreaming and a
35:07
normalization of these loonies somewhere i mean who is a loonie and who is not some of these loonies are in power some
35:13
of these loonies are in m are our mps i mean how long are we going to call them loonies yeah we've had some mps actually
35:19
saying they wanted statues of mahatma gandhi replaced by statues of god say so it's not
35:25
it was quite right there is definitely a mainstreaming of points of view that would not have been considered you know
35:31
respectable to us even behind closed doors but a credit where do you i think the prime minister himself came out and
35:36
said he would never forgive the concerned mp uh from bhopal who made those statements why whatever you know
35:41
but she was made an mp before you know when she was made an mp she had already made statements about god's sake my
35:48
point is the moment you make her an mp you are effectively saying it's okay you know as long as you can win an election
35:53
you can say what you want you can valorize god say and demonize gandhi but you know dr the flip side this is about
36:00
at one level competitive intolerances about the use of power take a look at in your home state of kerala political
36:07
controversy brewing over the inclusion of the works and thoughts of rss ideologues like goldworker
36:15
upadhyay and and i don't know where madoka fitted into that and there's a huge outcry so the
36:21
left is equally intolerant nobody you know why should i not know
36:27
about savakar or goldwater you know why why can't there be
36:32
history which is with multiple voices exactly read in an objective manner
36:37
non-ideologically is that at all possible or are we too hyper polarized now to even appreciate it people you
36:45
know somebody sent me a a message when i said that i have vikram on the show oh he's the person who's whitewashing
36:51
savarkar for a new india so you see we seem so hyper polarized at the moment
36:56
and he's not even read vikram's book so my point would precisely be this let's have multiple voices i supported
37:02
the proposal to include these rss the idea logs in the syllabus because it is only by reading them and understanding
37:09
their thinking that you can decide where you stand in relation to them will your party leadership support you on that no
37:15
or you'll be once again ostracized look at that bad boy i've already taken my public stand and i was isolated by the
37:21
point you are isolated by your own partner look i'm i'm somebody who has quoted extensively from savankar and
37:26
goldwalker in my writings so how can i deny others the privilege of reading the same sources that i read to my my point
37:34
of view i don't agree with them but it's only by reading them that i know that i don't agree with them so you cannot and
37:39
should not deny college students university students the right to be exposed to a wide variety of views and
37:45
come to their own conclusions that applies to history that applies to ideas that's what education is supposed to be
37:51
all about it's to give you the equipment intellectually to discern according
37:57
ultimately to your own value choices if necessary your own ideology i believe that it was wrong and in the
38:03
end they have indeed prescribed those texts i believe it was wrong to do so and i have no hesitation in saying i'll
38:08
stand up for academic freedom and intellectual freedom against even the the sort of ideologues on my own
38:14
side of the fence because i genuinely believe in having as wide a range of
38:20
materials sources and information as i said to vikram earlier let's have both both views about the same period let's
38:26
read the understand this both views there are multiple views about many periods of indian history in which there's not just one conclusion the the
38:33
intelligent reader and the intelligence student should be exposed to and have an
38:38
opportunity to see what everyone is reading writing arguing and then make their own minds up but then we'll have a
38:44
better information is that possible i ask you that you know you're looking at an ideal situation where academic
38:50
freedom intellectual freedom exists but it doesn't in in the hyper polarized society where people are getting so
38:57
sharply divided them versus us is it possible are we living in an illusory world dr
39:05
where it is simply not possible anymore to have these debates without polarizing
39:10
society even further that's only because the ruling powers and the ruling establishment appear to have taken
39:18
particular sides in this debate if the government stayed out of the debate and the government and the ruling party and
39:24
that entire panoply of power influence media influence all of that that comes
39:30
with it if they stood back and said let this be discussed amongst intellectuals amongst historians amongst uh
39:37
journalists that i think would be fine and we can have all these views i would love to read more of vikram and read
39:42
more of leftist historians how does it matter it's when the government has one point of view that appears to be the one
39:49
that they are railroading to the consciousness of indians that everyone gets alarmed and says here you're
39:54
polarizing the country sorry to say what about riya but that's exactly what would have been said 25 years ago when you
40:01
were in power you see that's the problem i was happily at the u.n so don't say true but i take your point dr is in a
40:08
magnificent minority uh you know who who believes in this open-mindedness that as i said history is a handmaiden of the
40:14
ruler so in the past when ichr was created and so on i i spoke about how even during the british time you had
40:21
space for an alternate view whereas uh you know post-independence it's a paradox that we do not have these
40:26
alternate views to to thrive i mean carriers have been destroyed fellowships are denied so many stories like this
40:33
only because you didn't tow a particular line so every dog has its day so some people are now looking back and saying
40:39
it's our time now you can't grudge them that saying now we have to be fair to everybody and so on where were these
40:44
virtues 20 25 years ago so now in fact as i said people who are
40:49
supportive of this government actually berated for not doing enough to actually bring a civilizational consciousness or
40:56
uh something a re uh you know statement of history so in fact uh they they get the stick i
41:02
think on both sides but it's got to be high quality let's be honest part of the problem is it's not just
41:08
about junking the past it's if you're going to rewrite history yeah please ensure that you do it with some
41:15
element of integrity and quality i ask you therefore between so-called secularizing history and communalizing
41:22
history is there a middle ground yes that we can find truthifying history i guess that is sorry the truthifying
41:28
history sorry fine you're calling it truthfully identifying indian history and let people read what is the truth uh
41:34
as uh however inconvenient let us stare it in the face let's just
41:39
get done with it i think we have a very very troubled past uh and since as i state it again since we've not made
41:46
peace with it we will keep having these fishes emanating all the time whether it is in ayodhya whether it is in somewhere
41:51
some other place if we had settled these for for good uh i think these uh the problems would not arise
41:58
in one of my novels right i have a character a foreigner an american saying to the indian characters the problem
42:04
with your country is you have far too much history for you to be able to consume it i mean you know it's
42:09
overflowing you're all you're all busy using history as a battle axe to hit
42:15
each other with and this character is somebody who's trying to sell a popular beverage in india and he says i don't care about your past i'm only interested
42:21
in your future and increasing my sales here you guys should be thinking about the future too and frankly i have some
42:27
sympathy for that point of view i love reading history i've enjoyed writing it as an amateur i don't claim to be a
42:32
historian as vikram is but i would say that history should belong to the past and to
42:39
multiple understandings of the past and vikram says the truth so if you look selectively at only the
42:45
rape the pillage the destruction of temples or force conversions you have one kind of truth about that period in
42:52
northern india in particular if you look only at incident after incident of hindus going and worshiping
42:59
for example ghazi mia in bharach is this fellow who was a muslim warrior whose revere is a hindu saint today
43:06
you've got people in many many parts of of india who were if there was a natural
43:12
calamity and a temple was destroyed the local muslims would come and rebuild it and vice versa for a masjid we've had so
43:17
many examples like that are also present in our history if you only look at that selectively
43:22
you'll have a different truth and maybe you read both sets of accounts you arrive at a third truth i feel we should
43:28
let people have their own understandings provided no one seeks to assert a monopoly of one
43:35
version of the truth that's where i would leave it let us let history remain contested for the past but let us not
43:43
bring those contests over into the present and thereby compromise our future maybe we should have a film maybe
43:48
we should have a film on kabir instead of aurangzeb indeed maybe we should have a film on uh on on
43:55
bridge builders rather than a goat say yeah you know there are any number of you know i have a great film on
44:00
vivekananda instead of a film on goat say have a film on uh on kabir instead of ghastly but maybe we live in a era
44:08
whereas in bhajrangi bhaijan you know the actor says
44:16
and i just wonder whether even history has got caught in these competitive hatreds of our time i just wonder it has
44:23
rajdeep and i would agree with dr through there about these multiplicity of views i've always held as a historian
44:29
that it's that famous poem we read as children you know the blind men and the elephant
44:34
each blind man touches one part of the elephant and says the elephant looks like the trunk the tail the the body and
44:40
so on they're all right and they're all wrong as well history is that each person looks at one aspect based on
44:47
either biases or the evidences that are available to them and reconstruct the sum of all the parts so do not deny any
44:54
part in the false miyazama of contemporary politics contemporary social cohesion
44:59
and so on and as i said de-hyphenate today's muslims from these invaders of the past make new icons who actually
45:06
represent that composite culture who actually represent that peaceful version uh that you talk of rather than uh you
45:13
know actually deny and have this negationism that oh aurangzeb was actually very secular oh but you know
45:19
the way to do that is to go back to the constitution the constitution gives us a roadmap where we can all enjoy our own
45:26
autonomy and we have be empowered as citizens of a free democratic republic let's do that and not in fact demonize
45:34
people for what happened centuries before our republic was even born let's leave it there because we are 75
45:40
years into our independence and 75 years is a good step to look forward
45:47
rather than look at the past possibly with anger and certainly not with hatred
45:53
this country as yesterday thomas friedman called it is a miracle country a country of great pluralities let's
46:00
celebrate that diversity rather than somehow or the other demonize our past
46:06
and that's really what historians need to do provide us with those multiple voices that reflect the diversity of
46:13
this unique country thank you both very much for joining us [Applause]
