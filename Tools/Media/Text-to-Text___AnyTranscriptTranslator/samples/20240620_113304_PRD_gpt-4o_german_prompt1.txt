### Guide to Managing Elephant Flows in Network Systems

#### Introduction to Elephant Flows
Elephant flows refer to data flows that exceed one gigabit over a span of 10 seconds. While these flows are not frequent, they can consume significant bandwidth over time, potentially leading to high CPU usage or packet loss.

#### Detecting and Remediating Elephant Flows
Starting with version 7.2.0 of the management center, applicable to Store Three devices only, the elephant flow feature can be utilized to detect and manage these large data flows, reducing stress on network devices.

#### Remediation Actions

1. **Bypassing Elephant Flows**
   - Configure the system to bypass elephant flows, allowing them to circumvent Snort inspection when enabled. This ensures that Snort does not process any packets from the bypassed flow.

2. **Throttling Elephant Flows**
   - Apply rate limiting to the flow while maintaining Snort inspections. The flow rate is dynamically calculated and reduced by 10%. Snort will set the Quality of Service (QoS) flow verdict to reflect this 10% reduction and relay this information back to the firewall engine.

By implementing these remediation actions, network administrators can effectively manage elephant flows, ensuring optimal network performance and reduced device stress.
